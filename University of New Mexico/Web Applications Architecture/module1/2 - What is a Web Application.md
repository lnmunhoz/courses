# What is a Web Application?

The most basic model for describing relationship between programs on web is the
client-server architecture.

##The Client-Server Architecture:

###The two parts of this architecture are:
- Server component that listens for request and provide services.
- The Client that establishes connection to the server and makes requests.
- There is a request/response protocol associated with any client-server
architecture.

A Web Application is accessed by users over the network using the browser (client)
and consist in a collection of client and server-side scripts, HTML pages, and
other resources that may be spread across multiple servers. - Amazon

  and installing software on computers

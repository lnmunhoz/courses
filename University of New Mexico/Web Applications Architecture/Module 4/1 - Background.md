# Ruby Programming Language

Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz") in the mid-1990s.

*"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more OO
than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."*

## Philosophy

*"Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."* - Matz

Designed according to the **Principle of Least Astonishment**. The language should behave
in a way to minimizes the confusion of experienced programmers.

Ruby is objected-oriented interpreted scripting language. Intuitive, flexible and extensible.

## Instalation

To check the last ruby version: `$ ruby --version`.

To see the gems you have installed: `$ gem list`.

To install rails: `$ gem install rails`.

## The Ruby Interpreter
Invoking the interpreter using the ruby command:
```bash
$ ruby -e 'puts "Hello World!"'
```
The `-e` prompt tells the interpreter to execute the line of ruby contained in the single quotes.

## Language Features

### Scripting
It can be used to write scripts that automate the execution of tasks.

### Imperative (procedure-oriented) programming
It has a traditional control structures found in imperative programs. You can create functions with variables (that store state).

### Objected oriented programming
Everything is an object, derived from the Object class.

### Functional programming
Computation proceeds via the evaluation of functions that depend only on their input, not the program state.

# The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural design pattern, implemented over
the middleware, is used in many web application frameworks and was introduced
as a means of dealing with complexity.

- Decouples data (model) and presentation (view).
- A controller handles requests and coordinates between the model and the view.
- More robust application, easy to maintain.

### Model
The domain-specific representation of the data.

### View
Renders the model in a view suitable of interaction.

### Controller
Mediates between the model and the view.

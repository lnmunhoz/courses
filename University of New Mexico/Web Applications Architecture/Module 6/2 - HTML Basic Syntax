#HTML - Basic Syntax

*I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP
and DNS ideas and ta-da! he World Wide Web.* - Tim Bernes-Lee

The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) was present in the document
sharing system that Bernes-Lee developed at CERN in the early 90's.

## Declarative Programming
Markup languages are examples of declarative programming languages:
- Program flow control is not specified
- Programs specify *what* not *how*

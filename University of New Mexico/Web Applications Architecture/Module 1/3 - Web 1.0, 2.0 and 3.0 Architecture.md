# Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 Architecture

Web 1.0 application architecture is not much more complicated than the
client-server model.

- The web server is primarily fetching static web pages.
- No separation of data from its presentation
- No interactivity
- The Browser is very simple (only need render HTML)
- More and less 100.000 Websites (read only web)
and 50M users generating and publishing content.
- As applications became large and richer, server-side scripts became more
complicated.

The Browsers keep adding more functionality on the client side. This generate
a lot of compatibility issues. And then, the Browser Wars starts.

#### The Browsers Wars
Was a competition for dominance between Netscape and
Microsoft. In 92 Netscape had most of the browser market and in 95 it was
almost complete. Netscape owned completely. But then by 2002 Microsoft
wrestle this away and IE became the prominent browser used for web applications.

Developers began to create applications with more interactivity (this require
save server state).

### Technologies improved performance
- Client-side scripts
- Faster web servers
- Web caching
- CDNs
- etc...

Web 2.0 and 3.0 application architecture are better organized to deal with
complexity. Server-side functionality is partitioned more intelligent.
The browser is more capable, with better standards supports.

## The Web 2.0
- 100.000.000 websites. (read/write web)
- 1B users
- More users reading content than generating.

## The Web 3.0
- 1B websites (read/write web)
- 2.5B users
- More users generating content than reading.
- Cloud intelligence
